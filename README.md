# Customer Segmentation using K-Means

## Project Overview
This project focuses on segmenting customers into distinct groups based on their income and spending behavior using the K-Means clustering algorithm. Customer segmentation helps businesses understand customer behavior and design targeted marketing strategies.

## Problem Statement
To group customers into meaningful segments based on their annual income and spending score using unsupervised machine learning.

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer-related information including:
- Customer ID
- Age
- Annual Income
- Spending Score

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Approach
- Loaded and explored the customer dataset
- Selected relevant numerical features for clustering
- Applied K-Means clustering algorithm
- Assigned cluster labels to each customer
- Visualized customer segments using scatter plots

## Model Used
- K-Means Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)

## Key Analysis
- Customers are grouped into distinct clusters based on income and spending patterns
- Helps identify high-value, average, and low-spending customers

## Outcome
- Successfully segmented customers into meaningful groups
- Demonstrated understanding of unsupervised learning techniques
- Improved insights for customer behavior analysis

## How to Run
